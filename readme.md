# Supabase automated self host

Deploy a self-hosted [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) instance with [Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia) for 2-factor authentication (2FA) and [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) or [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) as a reverse proxy, all with **ONE bash script!**

When using nginx, this project leverages [docker-nginx-certbot](https://github.com/JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot) image which handles requesting and renewing SSL certificates automatically.

üëâ If you find this project helpful, please consider leaving a ‚≠ê to show your support. You can also support my work by [Buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/_inder1). Thankyou!

## Prerequisites

- **A Linux Machine with docker installed**: This can be a server or any personal computer running Linux with at least 1 GB RAM and 25 GB Disk space. **The script has been tested only on Linux/WSL.**

- **Own Domain (optional)**: Required only if you're going to expose supabase services to the internet. You can get one for free from [freemyip](https://freemyip.com). Otherwise you can also run supabase locally (more on this in setup instructions)

## Setup Instructions

If you prefer a visual guide, check out this video where I deploy a self hosted supabase instance with Authelia to AWS in a few minutes:

[![Self-Host Supabase with 2FA and Caddy](https://imgur.com/wet0kVC.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhTBCGb0rTM "Self-Host Supabase with 2FA and Caddy - Just Run One Script!")

1. Download `setup.sh` script

   ```bash
    curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singh-inder/supabase-automated-self-host/refs/heads/main/setup.sh
   ```

2. Make script executable

   ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. Execute script

   üëâ If you only want basic username and password authentication

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

   üëâ If you want 2-factor authentication setup with authelia

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh --with-authelia
   ```

   üëâ To use nginx as reverse proxy:

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh --proxy nginx
   ```

   For more, you can run script with --help flag:

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh --help
   ```

   During script execution, you'll be prompted to enter some details:

   - **Enter your domain:** Enter the domain name where you want to access the supabase dashboard or make api calls. Make sure to specify the `http` or `https` protocol.
     For example: `https://supabase.example.com`

     ‚≠ê If you want to setup supabase locally, refer to this [Guide](https://github.com/singh-inder/supabase-automated-self-host/discussions/6)

   - **Enter username:** Enter your username.

   - **Enter password:** Enter your password.

   - **Do you want to send confirmation emails to register users? `[y/n]`:**

     - If you enter "yes", You'll need to set up your own SMTP server to handle emails. You can read more about it in [supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#configuring-an-email-server) or checkout my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iE-h_Wq2Js&t=1822s) for a practical walkthrough on setting up emails.

     - If you enter "no", users will be able to signup with their email & password without any email verification. Perfect for testing things out.

   The following additional prompts have to be answered only if you've enabled `--with-authelia` flag:

   - **Enter email:** Used by authelia for setting up 2-factor auth / reset password flow.

     ‚≠ê If you're not going to setup an SMTP server, you can enter any email here. When not using SMTP server, you can easily view codes sent by authelia in `docker/volumes/authelia/notifications.txt`

   - **Enter Display Name:** Used by authelia in emails and [dashboard](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7a4c0b8-920e-4b61-9bb5-1cae26d5bbe9).

   - **Do you want to setup redis with authelia? [y/n]:** By default, authelia stores session data in memory. If authelia container dies for some reason every user logged into supabase dashboard will be logged out. If you're going to production, Authelia team [recommends](https://www.authelia.com/configuration/session/redis/) to use redis.

Thats it!

After script completes successfully, cd into `supabase-automated-self-host/docker` directory and run `docker compose up -d`. Wait for containers to be healthy and you're good to go. To access dashboard outside your network, make sure that your firewall allows traffic on ports 80 and 443.

## How this differs from coolify:

- Coolify is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides hosting solutions for various applications, while this project only sets up supabase with nginx/caddy and authelia.

- Coolify needs at least 2 GB RAM and 30 GB of disk space. Supabase itself only needs 1 GB ram and 25 GB disk space to start.

- With coolify, you're only getting basic username password auth. No 2FA.

- This project configures nginx or caddy as a reverse proxy.

- This script is definitely going to be faster than setting up through a GUI.
